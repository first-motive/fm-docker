# fm-docker

Shared container base for First Motive's ROS2 (Humble) robot stack. This repo
holds the base image, the entrypoint, and the host compose overlays that every
First Motive package repo builds on. It is the root of the image inheritance
chain — each downstream repo's image is `FROM` its parent, so dependencies point
down through clear layers instead of one monolithic build.

Each layer below is a separate package repo under the `first-motive` GitHub org,
assembled by the `fm-ros2` orchestrator.

## Image Inheritance

```
fm-docker base       ros:humble + tooling + viz + xacro/rsp        (view any robot)
   └ fm-robot   FROM base    + ros2-control                        (description + control + sensors)
        ├ fm-sim     FROM robot  + mujoco/gz/xvfb
        └ fm-teleop  FROM robot  + moveit/servo
   └ fm-app     FROM robot  + sim & teleop apt deps + textual      (full-stack launcher)
```

The base image is published to GHCR multi-arch (arm64 + amd64), so the same tag
runs on Apple silicon (OrbStack) and on Linux:

```
ghcr.io/first-motive/fm-docker:humble
```

## Quick Start

This repo is self-sufficient: it carries the host tooling to set up a container
runtime and to drop into the base image, so you can verify the layer without a
consumer repo.

```bash
# Set up the host runtime + pull the base image (no clone needed).
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first-motive/fm-docker/main/install.sh | bash

# Or from a clone:
./install.sh            # auto-detects macOS / Linux
./install.sh --no-pull  # runtime setup only, skip the image pull
```

```bash
# Drop into a ROS2 Humble shell. macOS always uses the container; Linux runs
# native ROS2 when /opt/ros/humble is present, else falls back to the container.
./run.sh

./run.sh --container    # force the container even when native ROS2 is present
./run.sh --local        # force native bare-metal (Linux only)
./run.sh --pull         # container path: force a refresh of :humble first
./run.sh --build        # container path: build Dockerfile.base locally
```

The container reuses the local `:humble` image and pulls only when it is
missing — the base rarely changes, so re-entry stays fast and works offline.

On macOS, `install.sh` installs OrbStack and starts the daemon; on Linux it
reports the Docker / NVIDIA / X11 tooling it finds and points at the fix for
what is missing — `install.sh` is idempotent, safe to re-run. `run.sh` picks
native ROS2 or the container per host and starts a fresh shell.

## Contents

| File                  | Role                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Dockerfile.base`     | Minimal ROS2 Humble base: build tooling, viz, xacro, rsp/jsp. |
| `ros_entrypoint.sh`   | Sources the ROS distro, then the workspace overlay if built.  |
| `compose.yaml`        | Shared compose base. Consumers set `FM_IMAGE` + `FM_WS`.      |
| `compose.macos.yaml`  | macOS (Apple silicon, OrbStack) overlay — sim only, no GPU.   |
| `compose.linux.yaml`  | Linux overlay — device passthrough, X11, host net (no GPU).    |
| `install.sh`          | Host setup: container runtime + base image pull. Curl-able.   |
| `run.sh`              | Pull (or `--build`) the base, drop into an interactive shell. |
| `scripts/lib.sh`      | Sourced host checks (OS, ROS2, GPU, docker, X11) — no actions. |
| `scripts/`            | macOS runtime actions: install OrbStack, ensure the daemon.   |
| `COLCON_IGNORE`       | Marks the repo so colcon never builds it as a package.        |

## Use From a Consumer Repo

Each package repo imports these overlays through its `*.repos` manifest and runs
the stack with its own `run.sh`. The base compose runs a published image; the
overlay adds the host-specific bits:

```bash
# macOS
FM_IMAGE=ghcr.io/first-motive/fm-robot:humble \
  docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.macos.yaml up

# Linux
FM_IMAGE=ghcr.io/first-motive/fm-robot:humble \
  docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.linux.yaml up
```

`FM_IMAGE` selects the layered image to run; `FM_WS` (default: current dir) is the
host workspace mounted at `/ws`. Only `FM_IMAGE` is required — `FM_WS` falls back
to the directory you run compose from.

## CI

Two workflows guard the repo:

- `ci.yml` runs on every pull request and push to `main`: shellcheck on the host
  scripts, an amd64 build of `Dockerfile.base` (no push), and a smoke test that
  the ROS runtime and the description/viz packages are present.
- `publish.yml` runs only on a push to `main` that touches the image, building
  multi-arch (arm64 + amd64) and pushing `:humble` to GHCR.
